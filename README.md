# car_model_recognizer
(work in progress)

-An ML model that takes images of cars as input and outputs the make and model of the car 

-Implemented using ResNet152, Tensorflow, and Keras

-Uses the stanford car dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset

-Weights for model.py can be found here: https://gist.github.com/flyyufelix/7e2eafb149f72f4d38dd661882c554a6 under tensorflow       weights
